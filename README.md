# WebMusicEducation

This is a school project where we (Ashane, Guy and JÃ¸rgen) are making a music education tool in the Web browser.

External tools/libraries that we can use

https://nexus-js.github.io/ui/api/#intro

https://tonejs.github.io/

My idea is to create a piano with several levels of engagement for different levels. It can be on different pages.

Level 1: for indeviduales that do not know how to play the piano. They get a titel of a familiar children tune for example and are          able to press ANY key on the piano roll and the notes will play the next note of the song choosen regardless if they are           wrong or right.

Level 2: (If we have time) The next note is highlighted or marked for the student to follow.
Level 3: BEER

To Do:
- check out p5 lib
- plan a design for the page (and piano)
- make a draw plan of the system (Guy?)
